      <h3 class="section-sub-title">10 & Under</h3>
      <p>10 and Under Tennis follows the same logic as other youth sports like baseball or soccer, which use kid-sized courts and kid-sized equipment. Kids learn to play baseball by first playing T-ball; they use shorter, lighter bats and larger, softer balls. Kids learning basketball shoot baskets with kid-sized balls on lowered backboards and they play soccer on smaller fields with smaller goals.</p>
      <p>Now with 10 and Under Tennis, balls bounce lower, don't move as fast through the air and are easier to hit. Kids tennis racquets are sized for small hands and courts are smaller and easier to cover. By using this format, the benefits are immediate and within a short time kids are rallying, playing, and excited to keep playing. That means kids will have more fun and less frustration. They're playing real tennis and having real fun—and that’s what is most important!</p>
