      <p>Eastlake Athletic Clubs are Elkhart County's largest local family owned sport and fitness clubs. They are owned and operated by Justin and Jason Evers, who grew up in the area and currently reside.  Eastlake Elkhart, was established in 2000 when the twins moved back home from Las Vegas as Tennis Professionals to pursue their dream of owning an athletic club.  Three years later they purchased the Goshen YMCA and converted it into their second club which was name Eastlake Athletic Club Goshen.  These two fifty thousand sq.ft facilities provide an opportunity for community adult and youth to engage in a variety of fitness and sport programs.</p>

Eastlake members now have access to all seven locations throughout Elkhart County.</p>
