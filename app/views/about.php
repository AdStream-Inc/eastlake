      <p>Eastlake Athletic Clubs are Elkhart County's premier racquet and fitness complexes. They are owned and operated by Justin and Jason Evers, who grew up in the area and currently reside.  Eastlake Elkhart, was established in 2000 when the twins moved back home from Las Vegas as Tennis Professionals to pursue their dream of owning an athletic club.  Three years later they purchased the Goshen YMCA and converted it into their second club which was name Eastlake Athletic Club Goshen.  These two fifty thousand sq.ft facilities provide an opportunity for members to have the convenience of two locations while providing a variety of sport and training programs.</p>
      <p>Due to overwhelming growth, in 2012 Jason and Justin opened two more 24 hour fitness facilities.  One located in Elkhart between the Goshen and Elkhart Clubs and the other located in  Middlebury.  Eastlake members have access to all four locations making EAC the largest family owned fitness facility in Northern Indiana.  Eastlake Clubs are proud of their professional staff and look forward to serving the Health, Fitness, and Athletic needs of the greater Elkhart County.</p>
      <p>At all four of our clubs you'll experience an inviting atmosphere where friendliness, helpfulness and personal attention are our priorities. Our ongoing programs and activities bring members together and encourage lasting friendships.</p>
